# MNIST_3_Layer_NN
3-layer neural network architecture on MNIST digit dataset without using any built in deep learning library. Initially I randomly choose weight and bias. This neural network has 2 hidden layers in which I used 50 neurons in first hidden layer and 30 neurons in second hidden layer.
